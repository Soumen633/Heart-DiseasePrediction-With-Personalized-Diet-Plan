# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction with Personalized Diet Plan
This project presents an advanced Heart Disease Prediction System coupled with a sophisticated Personalized Diet and Lifestyle Recommendation Engine. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models, it accurately assesses an individual's risk of heart disease based on comprehensive clinical and lifestyle parameters. Beyond just prediction, the system intelligently crafts a tailored diet designed to mitigate identified risks and promote cardiovascular wellness.

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction System** integrated with a **Personalized Diet Recommendation Engine**.  
It uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease from clinical and lifestyle parameters, and then suggests a customized diet plan based on the risk level.

The project also saves trained models inside the `saved_model/` directory for reusability and performs several preprocessing and vital operations behind the scenes.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
- Python: The core programming language.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning model development and evaluation.
- Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and the user interface.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Heart disease risk prediction using ML models.
- Personalized vegetarian diet plan suggestions.
- Saves trained models inside `saved_model/` for later use.
- Interactive interface built with Jupyter Notebook (`Interface.ipynb`).
- Clean dataset included (`balanced_heart_disease.csv`).
- Modular structure for easy understanding and extension.

# 🛠️Extra Instructions

- Heart.ipynb → to train/evaluate model
- Diet_chart.ipynb → to generate personalized diet plans
- Interface.ipynb → to interact with the system
---
# ▶️ Usage
- Train the ML model using Heart.ipynb.

- A trained model will be saved automatically inside the saved_model/ directory.

- Run Interface.ipynb for an interactive prediction interface.

- Based on the prediction, use **Diet_chart.ipynb** to view the recommended diet plan.
